# Bhowmik et al 2023 AD Genetic Diversity Study
This is a repository of *R* data and script files to support manuscript outcomes. The repository is broken down based on manuscript section and those related steps, including figures included. The **Data** folder contains necessary outcomes to reproduce most results except for two RData files that were too large to upload to Github. Those include "LDpw.RData" and "GL.PCA.RData", which can be accessed here: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K5-zL2q3pSgiotsWUUxAQMnobbgmcVqC?usp=sharing]. If this link becomes inactive or there are issues downloading the files, please submit an issues note so it can be corrected. Files on actual animal genotypes are not provided due to a subset being from <Web-Interfaced next generation Database dedicated to genetic Diversity Exploration (WIDDE)>[http://widde.toulouse.inra.fr/widde/] and the other set (DREC) still being used for other research outcomes. Requests for those RData genotype files can be made to <Lauren Hanna>[lauren.hanna@ndsu.edu] and will be reviewed on a case by case basis.
